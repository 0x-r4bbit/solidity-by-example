## Solidity by Example
> Using Foundry


### Installation

Make sure to install Foundry first via

```
$ curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

This will give you a `foundryup` command. To install the latest version of Foundry, run:

```
$ foundryup
```

Here's a [guide to get started with Foundry](https://r4bbit.substack.com/p/smart-contract-development-with-foundry).

Then, clone this repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/0x-r4bbit/solidity-by-example
```

### Running the examples

Check out the `src` folder. There's a solidity file for every example and each file includes instructions on what to do.
